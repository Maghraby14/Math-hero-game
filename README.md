2. The user selects a button by clicking on it with the left mouse button.

### Gameplay

3. If the PLAY button is selected from the menu, the Math Hero game starts:
   - The game presents a continuous stream of simple random equations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) moving from the bottom of the game window to the top, similar to movie credits. The user's objective is to solve as many equations as possible within 60 seconds. The current score is displayed in the top left corner of the window.

   - The user inputs an answer by typing a number on the keyboard and pressing the Enter key. If the answer is correct, the score increments by one; if incorrect, no change occurs.
   - After 60 seconds, the game stops automatically, and a window appears displaying the user's final score and rank.
